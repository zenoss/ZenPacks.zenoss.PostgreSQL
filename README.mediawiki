This ZenPack makes it possible to monitor the performance of a PostgreSQL
database server, the individual databases, and the tables within those
databases.

== Features ==

The features added by this ZenPack can be summarized as follows. They are each
detailed further below.

* Discovery of PostgreSQL components.
* Monitoring of PostgreSQL metrics.

=== Discovery ===

The following types of components will be automatically discovered. The
attributes and collections will be updated on Zenoss' normal remodeling
interval which defaults to every 12 hours.

;Databases
* Attributes: Name, OID, Size, Table Count
* Collections: Tables

;Tables
* Attributes: Name, OID, Schema, Size, Size, Database

=== Monitoring ===

The following metrics will be collected every 5 minutes by default.

;Server
* Metrics: Summaries of all databases and tables.

;Databases
* Metrics: Size, Backends, Summaries of all tables.
* Latency Metrics: Connection, SELECT 1
* Connection Metrics: Total, Active, Idle
* Duration Metrics: Active Transactions (min/avg/max), Idle Transactions (min/avg/max), Queries (min/avg/max)
* Efficiency Metrics: Transaction Rollback Percentage, Tuple Fetch Percentage
* Transaction Rate Metrics: Commits/sec, Rollbacks/sec
* Tuple Rate Metrics: Returned/sec, Fetched/sec, Inserted/sec, Updated/sec, Deleted/sec
* Lock Metrics: Total, Granted, Waiting, Exclusive, AccessExclusive

;Tables
* Scan Rate Metrics: Sequential/sec, Indexed/sec
* Tuple Rate Metrics: Sequentially Read/sec, Index Fetched/sec, Inserted/sec, Updated/sec, Hot Updated/sec, Deleted/sec
* Tuple Metrics: Live, Dead

== Usage ==

Once the PostgreSQL ZenPack is installed you will have the following new
configuration properties which should be set either for device classes or
individual devices.

;Configuration Properties
* ''zPostgreSQLPort'' - Port where PostgreSQL is listening. Default: 5432
* ''zPostgreSQLUseSSL'' - Whether to use SSL or not. Default: False
* ''zPostgreSQLUsername'' - Must be a superuser. Default: postgres
* ''zPostgreSQLPassword'' - Password for user. No default.

In addition to setting these properties you must add the ''zenoss.PostgreSQL''
modeler plugin to a device class or individual device. This modeler plugin
will discover all databases and tables using the connectivity information
provided through the above settings. Each database and table will
automatically be monitored.

=== PostgreSQL Server Impact ===

Zenoss will run the following queries every five (5) minutes. These queries
are intended to be lightweight so as to not adversely affect the server's
performance.

<syntaxhighlight lang="sql">
-- Database statistics - Run once.
SELECT d.datname,
       pg_database_size(s.datid) AS size,
       numbackends,
       xact_commit, xact_rollback,
       blks_read, blks_hit,
       tup_returned, tup_fetched, tup_inserted,
       tup_updated, tup_deleted
  FROM pg_database AS d
  JOIN pg_stat_database AS s ON s.datname = d.datname
 WHERE NOT datistemplate AND datallowconn

-- Connection statistics - Run once.
SELECT datname, xact_start, query_start, backend_start,
       now() AS now
  FROM pg_stat_activity

-- Lock statistics - Run once.
SELECT d.datname, l.mode, l.granted
  FROM pg_database AS d
  LEFT JOIN pg_locks AS l ON l.database = d.oid
 WHERE NOT d.datistemplate AND d.datallowconn

-- Table statistics - Run once per database.
SELECT relname,
       pg_relation_size(relid),
       pg_total_relation_size(relid),
       seq_scan, seq_tup_read,
       idx_scan, idx_tup_fetch,
       n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del,
       n_tup_hot_upd, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup,
       last_vacuum, last_autovacuum,
       last_analyze, last_autoanalyze
  FROM pg_stat_user_tables
</syntaxhighlight>

The following queries will be run whenever the PostgreSQL server device is
remodeled. This occur once every 12 hours.

<syntaxhighlight lang="sql">
-- Database list - Run once.
SELECT d.datname, s.datid, pg_database_size(s.datid) AS size
  FROM pg_database AS d
  JOIN pg_stat_database AS s ON s.datname = d.datname
 WHERE NOT datistemplate AND datallowconn

-- Table list - Run once per database.
SELECT relname, relid, schemaname,
       pg_relation_size(relid) AS size,
       pg_total_relation_size(relid) AS total_size
  FROM pg_stat_user_tables
</syntaxhighlight>
